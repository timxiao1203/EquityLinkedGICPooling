# EquityLinkedGICPooling
The Pooling Criteria is the process of grouping like securities for the purpose of creating a pseudo-GIC to efficiently hedge the total balance.  The new process will group a portion of the GICs, greater than 3 million, into pools and leave the remaining GICs in Unallocated pools.
